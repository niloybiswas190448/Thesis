- **Mid Income Group:** Balance cost and service quality considerations
- **High Income Group:** Value time savings and comfort over cost

### 2. Mode Performance
- **MRT:** Highest overall performance score (0.940) in MCDA
- **Bus:** Good balance of accessibility and efficiency (0.851)
- **Leguna:** Lower performance but important for last-mile connectivity (0.441)

### 3. Affordability Challenges
- **Low Income:** 44.3% of trips are unaffordable at current fares
- **Mid Income:** 13.2% affordability constraint
- **High Income:** Minimal affordability issues (2.0%)

### 4. Value of Time Variations
- **Income Gradient:** VOT increases significantly with income level
- **Policy Implications:** Higher income groups more sensitive to time savings
- **Service Design:** Time-based improvements more valuable for high-income users

## Policy Recommendations

### 1. Differentiated Pricing Strategy
- **Low Income:** Implement targeted subsidies (40% reduction)
- **Mid Income:** Standard fares with moderate subsidies (10% reduction)
- **High Income:** Market-based pricing with premium service options
